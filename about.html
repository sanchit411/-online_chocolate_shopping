                    In 1962, Chuck Senior and Nancy Deadman opened the doors to their Bertha's Deluxe Chocolate. They began with 19 flavors of their homemade super-premium ice cream. The thought was that they could make their candies and a bit of ice cream to be content. As their ice cream gained in popularity in the Madison area, they began selling to local restaurants. Soon the ice cream portion became the main focus of their business. At that time, the name became Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream.
                    
                    In 1976, their eldest son, Chuck Junior along with his wife, Jacque, came back to Madison and wanted to continue the business' growth and development. Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream manufacturing then moved to its current location at 2221 Daniels St. Dave Deadman, the youngest son, came back to the company in the early 90's. He helped give a new image to Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream with a new logo and a boost to get the company where it is today.
                    
                    Now Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream is run by Chuck Junior and Dave under the watchful eye of their father, Chuck Senior. They currently own and operate three retail stores in Madison as well as the manufacturing plant where they manufacture the 100 flavors of super-premium ice cream!
